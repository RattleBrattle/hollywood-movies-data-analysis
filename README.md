# Movies Dataset Analysis & Insights

## Overview
This project performs a full analysis of a movies dataset â€” from raw data validation and cleaning to detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and storytelling.  
The goal was to uncover trends in **profitability**, **audience vs critic reception**, **worldwide gross**, and **genre/studio performance** over time.  
It also explores correlations between variables and answers key business-oriented questions about the movie industry.
